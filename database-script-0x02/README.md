# Database Seeding (DML)

This folder contains the **SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)** script to seed the Airbnb database with sample data.

## Files
- **seed.sql** → Inserts sample data into all entities (`User`, `Property`, `Booking`, `Payment`, `Review`, `Message`).
- **README.md** → This file, explaining the purpose.

## Sample Data Includes
- 3 users (guest, host, admin).
- 2 properties hosted by a host.
- 2 bookings (confirmed + pending).
- 1 payment linked to a booking.
- 1 review left by a guest.
- 1 message exchanged between a guest and a host.

The data simulates real-world Airbnb usage to test the schema.
